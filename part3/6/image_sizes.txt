backend before: 1.07GB
frontend before: 1.27GB

backend after: 1.07GB
frontend after: 1.28GB

I don't know why but joining the RUN commands for frontend actually increased the size. I both tried a version where dependencies are installed before copying all files (COPY package* ./) with two seperate RUN commands and also a version where eveything is copied at once and there is only one RUN command but both versions were 1.28GB while the original (rootless) version was 1.27GB.

For the useless parts, my images are based on the node and golang images so I didn't install any additional dependencies.

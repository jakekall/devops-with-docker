I used the Dockerfile I made for the Java Spring project in exercise 1.11

Original size: 435MB
Size after changes: 134MB

I changed the build to multi-stage where the first stage has the full jdk while the second only has jre to run the app. Both stages use alpine.
Only the jar is copied over and source files are ignored.
I added an user "appuser" so that the jar is not executed as root.
